# movie-webapp

In this project we aim to build a website about movies. Users can get information about the top 250 movies, movies that are currently in cinemas, statistics about movies that have been added to the personal watched account on trakt and much more. 

To get the required information, we access several APIs: the Trakt API, the The Movie Database (TMDB), and the unofficial IMDB Api.

We used the two libraries ChartJS and EmailJS.
